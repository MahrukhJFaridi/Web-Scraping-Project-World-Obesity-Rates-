# Web-Scraping-Project-World-Obesity-Rates-
In this web scraping project, I examined global obesity rates for both men and women. I began by inspecting a webpage, where I carefully examined the underlying HTML structure to understand how the data was organized. Armed with this knowledge, I embarked on the extraction process using Python, employing the powerful Pandas library to handle the data.

My approach involved several key steps. Initially, I targeted the titles and performed essential cleaning procedures to ensure uniformity and accuracy. Subsequently, I constructed a structured data frame capable of housing the extracted data efficiently.

To populate the data frame, I employed a systematic approach, utilizing a for loop to iterate through the rows and columns of the webpage's data table. Extracting each data point, I meticulously inserted it into the corresponding cells of the data frame, ensuring completeness and integrity.

As I progressed, my focus shifted to exploring female obesity rates exclusively. Following a similar methodology, I created a separate data frame, this time with a single column dedicated to capturing female obesity statistics. Once again, I meticulously extracted and inserted the relevant data into this specialized data frame.

The final step of this project involved merging the two data frames, thereby consolidating the comprehensive dataset containing both male and female obesity rates. Through meticulous extraction, cleansing, and organization, our web scraping endeavor yielded a valuable resource for further analysis and insight into global health trends.
